Matchup Knowledge: Research common matchups to know how to play against different champions.
Adaptation: Adjust your playstyle or counterpick based on your opponent's champion.

Pushing: Apply pressure on the map by pushing waves or resetting them.
Dominance: Control waves to maintain lane dominance and create opportunities.
Trading and Harassment
Positioning: Learn to trade efficiently with opponents without taking too much damage.
Resource Management: Manage health, mana, and cooldowns during trades.
Harassment: Apply pressure on opponents without overextending.
Vision Control
Warding: Place wards strategically to gain vision and avoid ganks.

Team Coordination: Communicate with your team to control vision and track the enemy jungler.
Roaming and Map Pressure
Opportunities: Look for chances to roam and support other lanes.
